<p>The first approach is a human written algorithm: take an image's red channel to filter out all non-red colors. Then, look for horizontal red and white stripes. This will lead to a few results which we can then filter out by comparing the faces of the the characters to the face of Waldo. </p>

<p>The second approach involves machine learning. This part is still a little unclear as to how it will be achieved as of yet, but the it will involve some form of studying pictures of Waldo alone and Waldo in group pictures. This will help the machine to learn where Waldo commonly hides and the best way to find him. </p>
