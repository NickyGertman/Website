# Where's Waldo: A Study in Image Recognition

#This project will compare two separate approaches to finding Waldo in the famous picture game, Where's Waldo. 

#The first approach is a human written algorithm: take an image's red channel to filter out all non-red colors. Then, look for horizontal red and white stripes. This will lead to a few results which we can then filter out by comparing the faces of the the characters to the face of Waldo.
